# Welcome {-}

This online book expands on the concepts introduced in *Mathematics for Machine Learning* by Marc Deisenroth, A. Faisal, and C. Ong.

You’ll find:

- Step-by-step theory walkthroughs  
- Worked examples and visualizations  
- Embedded video explanations  
- Subsection-level problem sets

The aim here is not to replace the textbook; but rather, we wish to provide additional supports for a more novice reader.  The ideas contained in the textbook, in our opinion, are accessible to a very wide audience - specifically one that lacks a strong mathematical foundation.  By providing additional examples and exercises and by breaking down the notation, we hope to expand the audience to a wider audience.  To read this book, the audience should begin with a very basic understanding of calculus (perhaps at a first year level).
