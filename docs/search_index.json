Faisal, and C. Ong. You’ll find: Step-by-step theory walkthroughs Worked examples and visualizations Embedded video explanations Subsection-level problem sets The aim here is not to replace the textbook; but rather, we wish to provide additional supports for a more novice reader. The ideas contained in the textbook, in our opinion, are accessible to a very wide audience - specifically one that lacks a strong mathematical foundation. By providing additional examples and exercises and by breaking down the notation, we hope to expand the audience to a wider audience. To read this book, the audience should begin with a very basic understanding of calculus (perhaps at a first year level).
